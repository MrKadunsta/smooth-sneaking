# Smooth Sneaking
\--- Better toggle sneak ---

Have you ever noticed that when you enable toggle sneak in creative or spectator mode, pressing shift toggles the flying down action which is super annoying. But it doesn't make sense to switch settings whenever you switch gamemodes. Well with smooth sneaking, this is fixed.

\--- Easy setting change ---

I play bedwars, and I'm sure you have too. If you have, you probably know that sometimes you want to be able to use regular sneak, like speed bridging, but sometimes you want to toggle sneak, like when you're sneaking up on someone. Or in regular minecraft when you are saying hello to someone, you would want normal sneak, but in a deep dark, toggling sneak is the way to go. This mod also allows you to press both shifts at the same time to switch between modes.
